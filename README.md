# sagetrader

AWS Sagemaker project for financial analysis.

## Getting the data

The data is pulled from the Lynx API:

https://api.lynx.academy/?id=lynx-api-documentation

Examples of the API usage:

https://github.com/lynxbroker/API-examples/tree/master/Python

The data is stored in an S3 bucket.
After each data pull, the prediction runs on the most current data,
generating a decision about placing, cancelling or changing the buy/sell orders.

## Reinforcement learning

The project uses RL methods in order to maximize the expected income generated by the model.
The following modules are used:
* OpenAI Gym
* RL Coach
* Tensorflow

## Model

We will try several models:
* SageMaker DeepAR
* Keras LSTM
* PyTorch LSTM
* MXNet LSTM

The input of the model is consisted of the quotes of all the considered companies.
For each company, a given number of the last quotes are provided, along with timestamps.

The output of the model contains the confidence for each company to buy it, the buy price and the sell price.
