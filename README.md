The historical data will be stored in an S3 bucket.

The current data will be put in a Kinesis stream and sent to two target directions: 
* S3 bucket
* Sagemaker Inference API


## Reinforcement learning

The project uses RL methods in order to maximize the expected income generated by the model.
The following modules are used:
* OpenAI Gym
* RL Coach
* Tensorflow
